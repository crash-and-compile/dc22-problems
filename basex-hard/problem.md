# Base X

People usually have ten fingers, so we tend to think in base 10. Conspiracy theorests may believe that we have 10 fingers because we think in base 10. Who knows?

But what if you had 23 fingers?

This will be harder. The bases and values will be more complicated.

## Note
Lower case letters indicate a base above 36.

## INPUT
The input will consist of two numbers per line: a number (X) on the left and another number (Y) on the right. These will be seperated by whitespace.

THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE LINES

## The Output
Print the lowest bases of both numbers which will cause both numbers to be equivalent. Separate these numbers with whitespace.

## Sample input
	4	100

## Sample output
	10	2
