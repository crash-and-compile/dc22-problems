# Base X

People usually have ten fingers, so we tend to think in base 10. Conspiracy theorests may believe that we have 10 fingers because we think in base 10. Who knows?

But what if you had 23 fingers?

This is the easy version, so we'll keep it simple at first.

## INPUT
The input will consist of three numbers to a line: a number (X) on the left, an initial base (Y) in the middle, and an output base (Z) on the right. These will be seperated by whitespace.

THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE INPUT LINES

## The Output
Print the value of X (which is displayed base Y) in base Z

## Sample input
