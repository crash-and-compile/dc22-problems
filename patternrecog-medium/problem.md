# Pattern Recognition

In this problem, your program will need to do some basic analysis of a pattern and
determine the next value.

Ok, now the difference between two consecutive numbers in the sequence is more complicated. 
The difference will be (2x+y) for some x and some y, each between 0 and 100.
Give me the next number in the sequence.

## INPUT
The input will consist of a series of numbers seperated by spaces.

## The Output
Print the next number in the series.

## Sample input
	22 35 48 61

## Sample output
	74
