# Pattern Recognition

In this problem, your program will need to do some basic analysis of a pattern and
determine the next value.

Ok, now the difference between two consecutive numbers in the sequence is more complicated. 

The difference will be (2x+y) for some x and some y, each between 0 and 100.
X will now become the number in the sequence.  Give me the initial values of x and y.

## INPUT
The input will consist of a series of numbers seperated by spaces.

## The Output
Print the values of x and y, separated by a single space.

## Sample input
	1 3 7 15

## Sample output
	0 1
