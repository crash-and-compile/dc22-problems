# Number Recognition

Let's see if you can handle a simple CAPTCHA problem. I'll give you a challenge, you tell me the number I'm looking for.

Let's start simple. I will give you a bunch of 1's mixed with l's. Tell me how many 1's there are. (If you are seeing double, you may want to get a sober assistant for this one....)

## INPUT
The input will consist of lines of 1's and l's

## The Output
Print the number of 1's (ones) in the input strings

## Sample input
	lllll1111ll

## Sample output
	4
