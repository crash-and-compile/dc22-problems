# Base X

People usually have ten fingers, so we tend to think in base 10. Conspiracy theorests may believe that we have 10 fingers because we think in base 10. Who knows?

But what if you had 23 fingers?

This will be a little trickier than the easy version, but if your maths work it shouldn't be a problem.

## INPUT
The input will consist of three numbers per line: a number (X) on the left, an initial base (Y) in the middle, and a desired number (Z) on the right. These will be seperated by whitespace

THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE LINES

## The Output
Print the base that the source number (X)  would need to be in to equal the desired number (Z). 

## Sample input
	4	10	100

## Sample output
	2
